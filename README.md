# Home WatchDog

This is a quick dirty home surveillance setup using a Raspi. It uses a Raspberry Pi 3 with a PiCam and detects any kind of movement in the room. If there is a movement, it captures the frame and uploads it to Dropbox (if configured).

This is the initial work by Adrian and I will be extending on this by including a motion sensor and some Telegram API alerts along with IFTTT implementation.

Yay Home Project!!!
